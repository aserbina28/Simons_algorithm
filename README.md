# Quantum Computing Final Project

This repository contains the code for my final project in quantum computing. The project focuses on implementing **Simon's Algorithm**, a quantum algorithm that solves Simon's problem exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm.

## Project Overview

Simon's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can be used to find a hidden binary string that satisfies a specific periodic property in a black-box function. This project demonstrates the power of quantum computing by implementing Simon's Algorithm and exploring its efficiency compared to classical approaches.

## Files

- `simons_algo.py`: The main Python file containing the implementation of Simon's Algorithm using a quantum computing framework (e.g., Qiskit).
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
